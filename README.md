## Environment creation
To be able to run our code a variety of libraries are needed. The easiest way to manage installations is through the use of an environment. We recommend creating an environment with anaconda by doing the following steps:

First we will create the environment using:
```console
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Then you will need to activate the environment using:
```console
conda activate sdagroup0
```

Whenever you are done with running the code you may deactivate the environment using:
```console
conda activate sdagroup0
```
